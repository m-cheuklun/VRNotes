__Answer__
> Flow
> Cybersickness

## Q3) Which of the following implementations will this design translate into?

- Constrict the FOV when moving
- Test users using the VRSQ
- Test users using the IPQ
- Create a walking-in-place location feature
- Create a teleportation locomotion feature
- Create a high-fidelity realistic 3D environment

__Answer__
> Constrict the FOV when moving
> Create a teleportation locomotion feature

## Q4) What data collection methods can be appropriate here?

![A design goal is to have minimal cybersickness in locomotion given the poor motion tracking fidelity of my phone in the cardboard](/images/DesignTranslate.png)

- Let users fill in the IPQ
- Let users fill in the VRSQ
- Let users fill in the FSS
- Perform semi-structured interviews with users
