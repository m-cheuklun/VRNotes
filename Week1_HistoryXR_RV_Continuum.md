## AR, VR, MR and XR
### What are they?
AR (Augment Reality): To augment the perspective of the physical world by overlaying the view of the physical reality
- Examples: Pokemon GO, Ingress, Pikmin Bloom, FNAF: Special Delivery

VR (Virtual Reality): To encompass the entire vision to a different plane or space
- Examples: Beat Saber, Half-Life: Alyx, Superhot VR, After the Fall

![image](https://github.com/TobyIO0085/VRNotes/assets/76524945/2daa3ff2-7bb2-4ccd-b0fe-7424817378df)

MR (Mixed Reality): Coined/Redefined by Microsoft, a way for the augmented reality to interact with the physical reality
- Examples: Meta Quest 3: Mixed Reality, HoloLens Minecraft

XR (Extended Reality): Term for encapsulating all of AR, VR and MR

### Immersive Media
Focus on the experience than the technology, coined by IMDA


## Milgram-Kishino's RV Continuum (Reality Virtuality)

[Paper on Milgram-Kishino's RV Continuum](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.197321)

### Dimensions of RV Continuum
![image](https://github.com/TobyIO0085/VRNotes/assets/76524945/17d511e2-a025-452b-a7d9-f7b9dbc3ea27)

The dimensions are split into three categories
- **Extent of World Knowledge** (EWK)
  - `Real World Unmodelled` ~~~~~~~> `Real World Completely Modelled`
  - How much the system is aware of the physical surrounding  ~~~~>
  - Example of actions close to which extent
    - `Real World Unmodelled`: An image of a cat
    - `Real World Completely Modelled`: Aware of user location/user is currently looking at the screen (HoloLens)
- **Reproduction Fidelity** (RF)
  - `No virtual content` ~~~~~~~> `Real and virtual content indistinguishable`
  - How realistic the assets are  ~~~~>
  - Example of actions close to which extent
    - `No virtual content`: A non-shaded 3D cube
    - `Real and virtual content indistinguishable`: Realistic tree with shadows/ Realistic dog with realistic movements
- **Extent of Presence Metaphor** (EPM)
  - `No display` ~~~~~~~> `Indistinguishable from direct viewing`
  - How much realism does the interaction affords ~~~~>
  - Example of actions close to which extent
    - `No display`: User uses mouse and keyboard to type out desires/interactions
    - `Indistinguishable from direct viewing`: User can pick up objects using hands / interact with gestures

__Answer__
> [D] or [E]
> No real-world environment, can be arguable it is not entirely virtual.
> Theory-wise, cannot be entirely virtual since it tracks your hands and user can slightly see real world through gaps in goggles.

## Q6) Where should Strava be placed in the RV Continuum?

![image](https://github.com/TobyIO0085/VRNotes/assets/76524945/3206420f-3e84-414a-9048-b58602b154d9)

__Answer__
> [B]
> Closer to reality since it tracks user location.
> Not entirely real since ...[Question is below].

## Q7) Why is Strava not considered to be near the "Real Environment" end of the RV spectrum?

- It has some "Extent of World Knowledge"
- It has some "Reproduction Fidelity"
- It has some "Extent of Presence Metaphor"

__Answer__
> [It has some "Extent of World Knowledge"]
> It is trying to gather data from the real world.
> And the higher the "Extent of World Knowledge", the more virtual it is.

## Q8) What is the common public perception of the difference between AR and MR?

- They are the same
- AR refers to blending virtual objects onto the real-world
- Virtual entities in MR can interact with real-world objects

__Answer__
> [Virtual entities in MR can interact with real-world objects]
> Coined by Microsoft, that MR can interact with real-world objects.
> Showcases HoloLens as MR hardware.
